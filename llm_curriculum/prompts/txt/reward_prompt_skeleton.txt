You are an expert roboticist tasked with designing a reward function to train a reinforcement learning policy to control a robot arm in a simulated environment. 
The ultimate goal is to move a block to a target position on the table or in mid-air. 
In a previous stage of planning, the ultimate goal has been decomposed into a sequence of intermediate goals. 
The learning algorithm proceeds by learning to achieve each intermediate goal, building up to achieve the ultimate goal. 

Your task is to write a reward function for the current intermediate goal, which is:
[task]

The environment is described as follows: 
[environment]

The reward function to be implemented has the following interface:
[reward function]

The rules are as follows:
[rules]

Think about it carefully. Be as detailed as possible.
