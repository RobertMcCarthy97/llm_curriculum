I have an agent in a MiniGrid environment.

The environment is a single room containing:
- The agent
- A green circle
- A red box

The agent can perform the following actions:
- Move forward
- Turn left 
- Turn right
- Pick up an object (max 1 at a time)
- Place object (if currently holding one)
- Open / close a door 

The final state the agent must reach is "Red box is beside green circle".
Can you list the intermediate states that must be reached for the agent to complete the task?

Rules: 
1. Do this in the same style as "Red box is beside green circle". 
2. Do not use dynamic/action information in the states (e.g. velocities actions), only use static information.
