"\ndef is_beside_green_key(observation) -> bool:\n    \"\"\"\n    This function checks if the agent is beside the green_key.\n    \n    We're assuming that 'beside' means that the agent is one cell away from the key, \n    either horizontally or vertically, but not diagonally. Therefore, we're applying\n    a Manhattan distance with a distance of 1, ignoring Euclidean distance.\n    \n    This function also assumes that the environment is a grid, with the positions \n    given as (x, y) tuples, where x increases to the right, and y increases downward. \n    Because we can simply subtract the coordinates to obtain the distance, these \n    assumptions help us verify the spatial relation between the agent and the key.\n    \n    :param observation: A dictionary carrying the observation.\n    :return: True if the agent is beside the green key, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    agent_pos = observation['agent_info']['position']\n    green_key_pos = observation['field_of_view']['green_key']['position']\n\n    dx = abs(agent_pos[0] - green_key_pos[0])\n    dy = abs(agent_pos[1] - green_key_pos[1])\n\n    return (dx, dy) in [(1, 0), (0, 1)]\n"
