It checks the observation dictionary to get the position of the agent and the green key. If the distance between the two (in terms of x and y coordinates, respectively) is either `(1, 0)` or `(0, 1)`, it means the agent is either horizontally or vertically adjacent to the green key and returns `True`. If there's no green key in the field of view, the function makes an early return of `False`."}]
