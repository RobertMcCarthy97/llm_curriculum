"\ndef is_red_ball_next_to_green_key(observation) -> bool:\n    \"\"\"\n    This function checks if the red ball is next to the green key.\n    \n    We're assuming that 'next_to' means that the red ball is one cell away from the green key, \n    either horizontally or vertically, but not diagonally. In other words, we're using \n    the Manhattan distance with a distance of 1, and not the Euclidean distance.\n\n    We're also assuming that the environment is a grid, and that the positions are \n    given as (x, y) pairs, where x increases to the right, and y increases downward.\n    That's why we can simply subtract the coordinates to calculate the distance.\n\n    Another assumption is that the 'red_ball' and 'green_key' are present within the \n    field of view of the agent (part of the observation).\n    \n    :param observation: A dictionary containing the observation.\n    :return: True if the red ball is next to the green key, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    red_ball_pos = observation['field_of_view']['red_ball']['position']\n    green_key_pos = observation['field_of_view']['green_key']['position']\n    \n    dx = abs(red_ball_pos[0] - green_key_pos[0])\n    dy = abs(red_ball_pos[1] - green_key_pos[1])\n\n    return (dx, dy) in [(1, 0), (0, 1)]\n"
