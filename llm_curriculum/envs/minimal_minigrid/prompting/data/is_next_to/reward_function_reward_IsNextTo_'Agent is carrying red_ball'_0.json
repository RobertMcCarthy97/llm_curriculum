"\ndef is_carrying_red_ball(observation) -> bool:\n    \"\"\"\n    This function checks if the agent is carrying the red ball.\n    \n    We're assuming that the information about whether the agent is carrying something \n    is stored in the 'carrying' field in 'agent_info', and that it will have the value \n    'nothing' if the agent isn't carrying anything, and the name of the object if the \n    agent is carrying something.\n    \n    As we are taking the value of 'carrying' directly from the observation, we are not \n    making any assumptions about the coordinates or properties of the objects. Also, the \n    name of the object the agent is carrying is assumed to match the object name in \n    the state; so in this case we assume it will exactly be 'red_ball' if the agent \n    is carrying a red ball. \n\n    :param observation: A dictionary containing the observation.\n    :return: True if the agent is carrying the red ball, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    carrying = observation['agent_info']['carrying']\n    return carrying == 'red_ball'\n"
