In this case, since it's mentioned to open a red door, the agent would need a red key. \n\nThought: Once the agent has the red key, it would need to navigate towards the door without placing the key back down. Thus, the agent must be in a state where it carries the key while next to the red door.\n\nThought: For the agent to use the key, it must be right next to the door. So an intermediate state is that the agent is next to the red door, still holding the red key. \n\nThought: The final state is that the red door should be open. This means that the agent would have already used the red key on the red door. \n\nBased on these thoughts, here are the objectives:\n\n<objectives>\n1. 'Agent is next to red key'\n2.
