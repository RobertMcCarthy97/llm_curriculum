It contains: red_door, red_key, \n\nThe agent can perform the following actions:\n- Move forward\n- Turn left \n- Turn right\n- Pick up an object (max 1 at a time)\n- Place object (if currently holding one)\n- Open / close a door \n\nThe final state the agent must reach is: 'open the red door'.\nCan you list the intermediate states that must be reached for the agent to complete the task?\n\nRules: \n1. Do this in the same style as 'red box is next to green ball'.  \n2. Do not use dynamic/action information in the states (e.g. velocities actions), only use static information.\n3. Always begin the list of intermediate states with <objectives> and end it with </objectives>\n---------------------------------------------------\nFollow this template: \nThought:  ${description of reasoning process}\n(repeat above any number of times needed...)\n\nThe objectives are: \n<objectives>\n#. ${short description of intermediate state}\n(repeat above any number of times needed...)\n</objectives>\n---------------------------------------------------\nExample of intermediate state:\n- 'Agent is next to grey door'\n- 'Agent is carrying yellow key'\n- 'Green door is open'\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let us derive the intermediate states based on the final objective. \n\nThought: Since the objective mentions opening a door, the agent would need the relevant key. In this case, since it's mentioned to open a red door, the agent would need a red key. \n\nThought: Once the agent has the red key, it would need to navigate towards the door without placing the key back down. Thus, the agent must be in a state where it carries the key while next to the red door.\n\nThought: For the agent to use the key, it must be right next to the door. So an intermediate state is that the agent is next to the red door, still holding the red key. \n\nThought: The final state is that the red door should be open. This means that the agent would have already used the red key on the red door. \n\nBased on these thoughts, here are the objectives:\n\n<objectives>\n1. 'Agent is next to red key'\n2. 'Agent is carrying red key'\n3. 'Agent carrying red key is next to red door'\n4. 'Red door is open'\n</objectives>"}]
