"\ndef is_red_door_open(observation) -> bool:\n    \"\"\"\n    This function checks if the red door is open based on the agent's observation.\n    \n    We're assuming that if a door is open, it might either be completely removed from the 'field_of_view',\n    or there will be changes in its listed attributes (e.g. an 'is_open' attribute set to True).\n    \n    If the red door is still visible and no 'is_open' attribute is detected or if it is there but set to False,\n    this would indicate that the door remains closed.\n\n    If the door is not in the field of view or if 'is_open' attribute is detected and is True,\n    we can infer that the door is open.\n\n    We are also assuming that the position of the door does not change since it is a stationary object\n    and its status (open/closed) not encoded in its position like the moving agent or the mobile key.\n\n    :param observation: A dictionary containing the observation.\n    :return: True if the red door is open, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    field_of_view = observation['field_of_view']\n    if 'red_door' not in field_of_view:\n        return True  # Assuming disappeared door means it's open\n    \n    red_door_status = field_of_view['red_door'].get('is_open', False)  # Check if 'is_open' attribute is present\n    return red_door_status\n"
