"\ndef is_red_door_open(observation) -> bool:\n    \"\"\"\n    This function checks if the red door is open. \n\n    From the observation, the agent can usually perceive objects or entities and their configuration in the field of view. \n    In this discussion, we will have to make a few assumptions. \n\n    Firstly, when no information about the door's state is given, we assume that the door is closed. \n    A door, when opened, might not be perceptible (as it is no longer blocking or obscuring the agent's view); in contrast, a closed door is always perceptible. \n\n    We also presume that the 'field_of_view' either contains details of doors present in the environment or does not include them at all. \n\n    As a result, if the red door is not present in the field of view, we infer that it is open. \n    If the red door is in the field of view, it means it's closed, so we return False.\n    \n    The function returns True if the door is open, False otherwise.\n\n    :param observation: A dictionary containing the observation.\n    :return: True if the red door is open, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    return 'red_door' not in observation['field_of_view']\n"
