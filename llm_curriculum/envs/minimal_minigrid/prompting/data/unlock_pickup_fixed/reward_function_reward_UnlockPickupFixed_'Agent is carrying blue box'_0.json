"\ndef is_carrying_blue_box(observation) -> bool:\n    \"\"\"\n    This function checks if the agent is carrying a blue box.\n    \n    We're assuming that if the agent is holding an object, it is described under the \n    'carrying' key of the 'agent_info'. If the agent is not holding anything, 'carrying' \n    is set to 'nothing'.\n    \n    Since we're only checking whether the agent is carrying a blue box or not, we don't \n    need to look at the field of view or any other pieces of information in the observation.\n    \n    :param observation: A dictionary containing the observation.\n    :return: True if the agent is carrying a blue box, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    carried_object = observation['agent_info']['carrying']\n\n    return carried_object == 'blue_box'\n"
