"\ndef is_in_room_0_1(observation) -> bool:\n    \"\"\"\n    This function checks if the agent is in room (0, 1).\n    \n    We're assuming that the room filled with objects is depicted by tuples (x, y),\n    where x and y represent the rows and columns of rooms respectively. In this case,\n    '0' stands for the first row and '1' stands for the second room from the left.\n\n    The 'agent_info' of the observation should contain a 'room' field which points\n    to the current room the agent is in, that is, in the form of a tuple (x, y). \n\n    This function simply extracts that value and checks whether it is equal to \n    tuple (0, 1) which would denote that the agent is in the desired room.\n\n    :param observation: A dictionary containing the observation.\n    :return: True if the agent is in room (0, 1), False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    return observation['agent_info']['room'] == (0, 1)\n"
