"\ndef is_not_carrying_object(observation) -> bool:\n    \"\"\"\n    This function checks if the agent is not carrying any object.\n    \n    We're assuming that the `carrying` field in the `agent_info` part of the observation \n    accurately reflects the current state of the agent. If it says 'nothing', then the \n    agent is not carrying anything. If it contains the name of an object, then the agent \n    is carrying that object.\n    \n    :param observation: A dictionary containing the observation.\n    :return: True if the agent is not carrying any object, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    carrying_status = observation['agent_info']['carrying']\n   \n    return carrying_status == 'nothing'\n"
