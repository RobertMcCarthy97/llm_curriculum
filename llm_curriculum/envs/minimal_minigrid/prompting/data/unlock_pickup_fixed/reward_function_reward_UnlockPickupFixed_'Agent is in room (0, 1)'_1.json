"\ndef is_in_room_0_1(observation) -> bool:\n    \"\"\"\n    This function checks if the agent is in room (0, 1).\n    \n    We're assuming that the room information is accurately recorded through the agent's position \n    on the grid map such that room (0, 0) is on the left and (0, 1) is on the right limit along the x-axis. \n    \n    We're using this information provided within the agent_info under the key 'room' which gives us the \n    information about the position of the agent in terms of rooms. This assumption also implies that\n    the environment's rooms are divided evenly along the x-axis.\n    \n    :param observation: A dictionary containing the agent's observation.\n    :return: True if the agent is in room (0, 1), False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    agent_room = observation['agent_info']['room']\n\n    return agent_room == (0, 1)\n"
