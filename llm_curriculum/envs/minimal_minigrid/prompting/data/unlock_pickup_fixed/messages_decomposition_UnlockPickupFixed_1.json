Do this in the same style as 'red box is next to green ball'.  \n2. Do not use dynamic/action information in the states (e.g. velocities actions), only use static information.\n3.

This key might unlock the door leading to the next room. The agent can't carry more than one item at a time, so after picking up the key, it should unlock the door before considering other objects.\n\nThought: After picking up the key, the agent will have to approach the yellow door. Only then can the door be unlocked.\n\nThought: Once the door is unlocked, the agent can proceed to the next room by navigating forward.\n\nThought: In the next room, the agent should drop the key since it's not needed anymore. This action will free the agent's carrying capacity to pick up the blue box.\n\nThought: Finally, the agent needs to find and approach the blue box in order to pick it up. This is the final state mentioned in the task description.\n\nThe objectives are: \n\n<objectives>\n1. 'Agent is next to yellow key'\n2. 'Agent is carrying yellow key'\n3. 'Agent is next to locked yellow door'\n4. 'Locked yellow door is open'\n5. 'Agent is in room (0, 1)'\n6. 'Agent is not holding anything'\n7. 'Agent is next to blue box'\n</objectives>"}]
