"\ndef is_next_to_yellow_door(observation) -> bool:\n    \"\"\"\n    This function checks if the agent is next to the yellow door.\n    \n    We're assuming that 'next to' means that the agent is one cell away from the door, \n    either horizontally or vertically, but not diagonally. In other words, we're using \n    the Manhattan distance with a threshold of 1, and not the Euclidean distance.\n    \n    We're also assuming that the environment is a grid, and that the positions are \n    given as (x, y) pairs, where x increases to the right, and y increases downward.\n    That's why we can simply subtract the coordinates to compute the distance.\n    \n    We must also account for scenarios where the yellow door is not in the agent's \n    field of view, in which case the function should return False.\n    \n    :param observation: A dictionary containing the observation from the environment.\n    :return: True if the agent is next to the yellow door, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    agent_pos = observation['agent_info']['position']\n\n    # The agent can only know about the yellow door if it's in its field of view.\n    if 'yellow_door' in observation['field_of_view']:\n        yellow_door_pos = observation['field_of_view']['yellow_door']['position']\n        dx = abs(agent_pos[0] - yellow_door_pos[0])\n        dy = abs(agent_pos[1] - yellow_door_pos[1])\n        return (dx, dy) in [(1, 0), (0, 1)]\n    else:\n        # If the yellow door is not in the agent's field of view, then the agent can't be next to it.\n        return False\n"
