"\ndef is_carrying_yellow_key(observation) -> bool:\n    \"\"\"\n    This function checks if the agent is carrying the yellow key.\n\n    In this particular state, we don't need any positional information or relative\n    positions of other objects. The only thing that matters is what the agent is\n    currently carrying.\n\n    We're assuming that the 'carrying' field of the 'agent_info' within the observation\n    accurately reflects whether the agent is carrying the yellow key. It will show the \n    name of the object the agent is holding, or \"nothing\" if the agent is not holding \n    anything.\n\n    :param observation: A dictionary containing the observation.\n    :return: True if the agent is carrying the yellow key, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    carrying_item = observation['agent_info']['carrying']\n\n    return carrying_item == 'yellow_key'\n"
