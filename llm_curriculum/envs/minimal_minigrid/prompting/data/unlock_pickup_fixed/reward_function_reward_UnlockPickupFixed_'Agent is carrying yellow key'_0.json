"\ndef is_carrying_yellow_key(observation) -> bool:\n    \"\"\"\n    This function checks if the agent is carrying a yellow key.\n    \n    We're assuming that the 'carrying' status of an agent is always accurately reported \n    under 'agent_info' in the observation. If the agent is indeed carrying an item, the \n    value of 'carrying' would be the name of the item i.e., 'yellow_key' in our case vs 'nothing' \n    if the agent is not carrying anything.\n        \n    :param observation: A dictionary containing the observation.\n    :return: True if the agent is carrying yellow key, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    carrying_status = observation['agent_info']['carrying']\n    return carrying_status == 'yellow_key'\n"
