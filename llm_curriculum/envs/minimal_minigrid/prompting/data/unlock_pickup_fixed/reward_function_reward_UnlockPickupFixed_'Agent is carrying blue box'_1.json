"\ndef is_carrying_blue_box(observation) -> bool:\n    \"\"\"\n    This function checks if the agent is carrying a blue box.\n    \n    The agent's carrying status is stated explicitly in the 'carrying' key under 'agent_info'.\n    If this field mentions 'blue_box', then the agent is indeed carrying the blue box. Else, it's not.\n    \n    The function doesn't make any assumptions about the positioning or directions, \n    because they are irrelevant for this specific state.\n    \n    :param observation: A dictionary containing the observed features.\n    :return: True if the agent is carrying the blue box, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    agent_carrying = observation['agent_info']['carrying']\n\n    return agent_carrying == 'blue_box'\n"
