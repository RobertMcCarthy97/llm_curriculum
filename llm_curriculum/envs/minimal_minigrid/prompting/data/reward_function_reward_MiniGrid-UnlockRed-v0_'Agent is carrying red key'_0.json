"\ndef is_carrying_red_key(observation) -> bool:\n    \"\"\"\n    This function checks if the agent is carrying the red key.\n\n    Our main assumption here is that the \"carrying\" field of the agent_info part of the observation\n    will be set to \"red_key\" when the agent is carrying the red key. We are also assuming that the \n    \"carrying\" field always exists in the observation and the value of this property is string type \n    which denotes the object the agent is carrying. If the agent is not carrying anything, \n    the \"carrying\" field will be set to \"nothing\".\n\n    Since we don't care about the position of the agent or what else is observable in the \n    environment in this state, we ignore all other fields of the observation.\n\n    :param observation: A dictionary containing the observation\n    :return: True if the agent is carrying the red key, False otherwise\n    \"\"\"\n    return observation['agent_info']['carrying'] == \"red_key\"\n"
