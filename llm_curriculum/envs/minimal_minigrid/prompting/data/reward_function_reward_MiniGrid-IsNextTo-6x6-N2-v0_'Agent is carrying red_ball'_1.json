"\ndef is_carrying_red_ball(observation) -> bool:\n    \"\"\"\n    This function checks if the agent is carrying the red ball based on the given observation.\n    \n    The assumption here is that the agent's carrying status is accurately reflected in the observation's \n    \"agent_info\" section under the \"carrying\" field. If it says \"red_ball\", the agent is carrying the red ball. \n    Otherwise, it is not.\n    \n    :param observation: A dictionary containing the observation.\n    :return: True if the agent is carrying the red ball, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    is_carrying = observation['agent_info']['carrying']\n    return is_carrying == 'red_ball'\n"
