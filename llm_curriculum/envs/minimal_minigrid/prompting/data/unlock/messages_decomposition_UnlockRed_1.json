The reasoning process involves a mixture of physical navigation actions (moving, turning) and interaction with specific objects (picking up the key, using the key to open the door).\n\nThe first consideration is finding the red key, since the red door can only be opened with a red key. Therefore, the agent first needs to navigate the room until it is next to the red key.\n\nNext, the agent needs to pick up the red key. The key is a physical object, so when the agent picks it up, it is unable to pick up any other object without first placing the key. Also, once the red key is picked up, it will be held by the agent until the agent places it down or uses it.\n\nThe final step is to navigate to the red door ensuring the agent is next to the door so it can open it using the key.\n\nThe objectives are: \n\n<objectives>\n1. 'Agent is next to the red key'\n2. 'Agent is carrying red key'\n3. 'Agent is next to the red door'\n4. 'Red door is open'\n</objectives>"}]
