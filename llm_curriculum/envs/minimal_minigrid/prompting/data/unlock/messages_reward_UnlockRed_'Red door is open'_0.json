In this case, since it's mentioned to open a red door, the agent would need a red key. \n\nThought: Once the agent has the red key, it would need to navigate towards the door without placing the key back down. Thus, the agent must be in a state where it carries the key while next to the red door.\n\nThought: For the agent to use the key, it must be right next to the door. So an intermediate state is that the agent is next to the red door, still holding the red key. \n\nThought: The final state is that the red door should be open. This means that the agent would have already used the red key on the red door. \n\nBased on these thoughts, here are the objectives:\n\n<objectives>\n1. 'Agent is next to red key'\n2. 'Agent is carrying red key'\n3. 'Agent carrying red key is next to red door'\n4.

In other words, we're using \n    the Manhattan distance with a distance of 1, and not the Euclidean distance.\n    \n    We're also assuming that the environment is a grid, and that the positions are \n    given as (x, y) pairs, where x increases to the right, and y increases downward. \n    That's why we can simply subtract the coordinates to calculate the distance.\n    \n    :param observation: A dictionary containing the observation.\n    :return: True if the agent is beside the red box, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    agent_pos = observation['agent_info']['position']\n    red_box_pos = observation['observation']['red_box']['position']\n\n    dx = abs(agent_pos[0] - red_box_pos[0])\n    dy = abs(agent_pos[1] - red_box_pos[1])\n\n    return (dx, dy) in [(1, 0), (0, 1)]\n```\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "```python\ndef is_red_door_open(observation) -> bool:\n    \"\"\"\n    This function checks if the red door is open. \n\n    From the observation, the agent can usually perceive objects or entities and their configuration in the field of view. \n    In this discussion, we will have to make a few assumptions. \n\n    Firstly, when no information about the door's state is given, we assume that the door is closed. \n    A door, when opened, might not be perceptible (as it is no longer blocking or obscuring the agent's view); in contrast, a closed door is always perceptible. \n\n    We also presume that the 'field_of_view' either contains details of doors present in the environment or does not include them at all. \n\n    As a result, if the red door is not present in the field of view, we infer that it is open. \n    If the red door is in the field of view, it means it's closed, so we return False.\n    \n    The function returns True if the door is open, False otherwise.\n\n    :param observation: A dictionary containing the observation.\n    :return: True if the red door is open, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    return 'red_door' not in observation['field_of_view']\n```\nKeep in mind, though, that this is working on the assumption that an opened door disappears from the agent's field of view entirely. Depending on the specifics of your environment, you might need to adapt this function accordingly. For example, if an open door remains in the agent's field of view but changes its state to \"open\", you would check that state in the observation instead."}]
