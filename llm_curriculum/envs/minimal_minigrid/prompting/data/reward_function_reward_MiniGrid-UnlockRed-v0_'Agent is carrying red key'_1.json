"\ndef is_carrying_red_key(observation) -> bool:\n    \"\"\"\n    This function checks if the agent is carrying a red key. \n\n    It does it by simply checking if the \"carrying\" attribute of \"agent_info\" is \"red_key\".\n\n    We're assuming that the information about what the agent is carrying is accurate and up-to-date in \n    the provided observation. Moreover, we assume that when the agent is carrying an item, the corresponding\n    field indicates the exact name of that item (e.g., \"red_key\" for a red key).\n\n    :param observation: A dictionary containing the observation.\n    :return: True if the agent is carrying a red key, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    return observation['agent_info']['carrying'] == 'red_key'\n"
