"\ndef is_carrying_blue_ball(observation) -> bool:\n    \"\"\"\n    This function checks if the agent is carrying the blue ball based on the agent's observation.\n\n    The observation is assumed to be in a specific dictionary format, where the key 'agent_info' provides\n    information about the agent's current status, including its position, direction, carried item, and room coordinates.\n\n    This function primarily checks the 'carrying' field in the 'agent_info'. It assumes that when the \n    agent carries an item, this field contains the name of the item (\"blue_ball\" in this case). If the\n    agent isn't carrying anything, it will be set to \"nothing\" or possibly another string indicating\n    the absence of an item.\n\n    :param observation: A dictionary containing the observation.\n    :return: True if the agent is carrying the blue ball, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    return observation['agent_info']['carrying'] == 'blue_ball'\n"
