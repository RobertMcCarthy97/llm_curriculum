"\ndef is_green_key_in_room_1(observation) -> bool:\n    \"\"\"\n    This function checks if the green key is in room (0, 1).\n    \n    Here, we're assuming that objects within the room (0, 1) are visible in the `field_of_view` \n    and have their room attribute set to (0, 1). Unfortunately, the provided example observation \n    doesn't contain room attribute for the objects, thus this detail is inferred on the basis of the \n    problem's requirements.\n    \n    Another assumption is that objects on the boundary of two rooms (e.g., exactly in the doorway)\n    are considered to be in the room they entered last.\n    \n    :param observation: A dictionary containing the observation.\n    :return: True if the green key is in room (0, 1), False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Check if the green key is present in the field of view\n    if \"green_key\" in observation['field_of_view']:\n        \n        # If present, compare the room attribute of the green key to (0, 1)\n        if observation['field_of_view']['green_key']['room'] == (0, 1):\n            \n            # If the room matches, return True\n            return True\n    \n    # By default return False i.e., the green key is not in room (0, 1)\n    return False\n"
