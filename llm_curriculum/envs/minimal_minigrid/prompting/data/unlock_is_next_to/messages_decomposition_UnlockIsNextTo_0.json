Do this in the same style as 'red box is next to green ball'.  \n2. Do not use dynamic/action information in the states (e.g. velocities actions), only use static information.\n3.

To access the second room, it must first pick up the key.\n\n1. 'Agent is next to green key'\n\nThought: With the green key in proximity, the agent can now pick it up.\n\n2. 'Agent is carrying green key'\n\nThought: Given the layout of the environment, the goal will be to utilize the key to unlock the green door. The agent must therefore move to the door.\n\n3. 'Agent is next to green door'\n\nThought: With the agent at the door and holding the key, it can now unlock and open the door, providing access to the second room.\n\n4.

'Agent is in room (0, 1)'\n\nThought: In the second room there is the grey box, which is part of the final state. However, the agent needs to drop the green key before it can manipulate the blue ball from the initial room.\n\n6.
