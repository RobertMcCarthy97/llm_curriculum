"\ndef is_beside_green_door(observation) -> bool:\n    \"\"\"\n    This function checks if the agent is beside the green door.\n    \n    We're assuming that 'beside' means that the agent is one cell away from the door, \n    either horizontally or vertically, but not diagonally - a Manhattan distance of 1.\n\n    We're also assuming that the environment is a 2D grid, and that the positions are \n    given as (x, y) pairs, where x increases to the right, and y increases downward. \n    That's why we can simply subtract the coordinates to calculate the distance.\n\n    The function also assumes that the information about the green door's position is present \n    in the 'field_of_view' section of the observation dictionary. If the green door is not in \n    the field of view, or if its data is not included in the observation dictionary for some reason, \n    the function will return False.\n    \n    :param observation: A dictionary containing the agent's observation.\n    :return: True if the agent is next to the green door, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    agent_pos = observation['agent_info']['position']\n\n    # The \"observation['field_of_view']\" dictionary should contain the key \"green_door\"\n    if 'green_door' not in observation['field_of_view']:\n        return False  # The green door is not in the field of view\n\n    green_door_pos = observation['field_of_view']['green_door']['position']\n\n    dx = abs(agent_pos[0] - green_door_pos[0])\n    dy = abs(agent_pos[1] - green_door_pos[1])\n\n    return (dx, dy) in [(1, 0), (0, 1)]\n"
