"\ndef is_green_door_open(observation) -> bool:\n    \"\"\"\n    This function checks if the green door is open based on the agent's observation.\n    \n    We're making several assumptions here:\n    \n    1. The 'field_of_view' section of the observation can contain information about the green door. \n    2. The green door's status is represented with a 'state' field within its information, and that this 'state' \n    field is set to 'open' when the door is open.\n    3. The absence of 'state' field or the green door in agent's field_of_view means that the door is \n    not within sight or observable range, in such case we return False as we cannot be sure that it's open.\n\n    :param observation: A dictionary containing the agent's observation.\n    :return: True if the green door is confirmed to be open, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    field_of_view = observation['field_of_view']\n   \n    if \"green_door\" in field_of_view:\n        if 'state' in field_of_view[\"green_door\"]:\n            return field_of_view['green_door']['state'] == 'open'\n    return False\n"
