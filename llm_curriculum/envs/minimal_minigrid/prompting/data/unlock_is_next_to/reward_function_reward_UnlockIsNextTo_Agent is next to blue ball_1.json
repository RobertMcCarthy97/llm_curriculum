"\ndef is_next_to_blue_ball(observation) -> bool:\n    \"\"\"\n    This function checks if the agent is next to the blue ball.\n\n    We're assuming that 'next to' means that the agent is one cell away from the blue ball,\n    either horizontally or vertically, but not diagonally. In other words, we're using \n    the Manhattan distance with a distance of 1, and not the Euclidean distance.\n\n    We're also assuming that the environment is a grid, and that the positions are \n    given as (x, y) pairs, where x increases to the right, and y increases downward.\n    That's why we can simply subtract the coordinates to get the distance.\n\n    Note: The function assumes the blue ball is within the agent's field of view. In reality, \n    (depending upon the specifics of the agent's observational capabilities and the environment rules) \n    we might need to handle scenarios where the blue ball is not within the agent's field of view.\n\n    :param observation: A dictionary containing the observation.\n    :return: True if the agent is next to blue ball, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    agent_pos = observation['agent_info']['position']\n    blue_ball_pos = observation['field_of_view'].get('blue_ball', {}).get('position', None)\n\n    # Ensure the blue ball is within the agent's field of view.
