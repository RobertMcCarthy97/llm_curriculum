"\ndef is_in_room_0_1(observation) -> bool:\n    \"\"\"\n    This function checks if the agent is in room (0,1).\n    \n    We are assuming that the current room of the agent is tracked in the \n    \"agent_info\" of the observation dictionary under the \"room\" key. This key maps\n    to a tuple that indicates the room coordinates, which could be something like\n    (0,0), (0,1), etc.\n    \n    :param observation: A dictionary containing the observation.\n    :return: True if the agent is in room (0,1), False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    current_room = observation['agent_info']['room']\n\n    return current_room == (0, 1)\n"
