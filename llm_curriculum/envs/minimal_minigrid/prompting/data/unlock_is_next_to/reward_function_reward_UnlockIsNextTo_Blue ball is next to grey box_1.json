"\ndef is_blue_ball_next_to_grey_box(observation) -> bool:\n    \"\"\"\n    This function checks if the blue ball is next to the grey box.\n    \n    We're assuming that 'next to' means that the blue ball is one cell away from the box, \n    either horizontally or vertically, but not diagonally. In other words, simmilar to the previous\n    example, we're using the Manhattan distance with a distance of 1, and not the Euclidean distance.\n    \n    The environmental assumptions such as the grid structure and position values are the same as \n    those mentioned in the previous example.\n    \n    Furthermore, we're assuming that the blue ball and gray box exist in the agent's \n    field of view; if they are not in the field of view, the observation would not have\n    information on their positions and state check cannot be reliably made.\n    \n    :param observation: A dictionary containing the observation.\n    :return: True if the blue ball is beside the grey box, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    blue_ball_pos = observation['field_of_view']['blue_ball']['position']\n    grey_box_pos = observation['field_of_view']['grey_box']['position']\n\n    dx = abs(blue_ball_pos[0] - grey_box_pos[0])\n    dy = abs(blue_ball_pos[1] - grey_box_pos[1])\n\n    return (dx, dy) in [(1, 0), (0, 1)]\n"
