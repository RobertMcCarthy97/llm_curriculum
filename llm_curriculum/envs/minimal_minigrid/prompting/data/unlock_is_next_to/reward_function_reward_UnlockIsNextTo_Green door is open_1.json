"\ndef is_green_door_open(observation) -> bool:\n    \"\"\"\n    This function checks if the green door is open based on the agent's observation.\n    \n    We're assuming that each door in the 'field_of_view' of the observation dictionary \n    also has a 'state' key, which can be either 'open' or 'locked'. We make this\n    assumption based on the 'yellow door' object in the provided example.\n    \n    We're also assuming that the door we're specifically interested in, \n    the green door, is represented as 'green_door' in the 'field_of_view' dictionary.\n   \n    To determine if the green door is open, we only need to check the 'state' attribute\n    of 'green_door' object in the 'field_of_view' dictionary within the observation.\n    \n    If 'green_door' is not present inside 'field_of_view', function will return False.\n    \n    :param observation: A dictionary containing the observation.\n    :return: True if the green door is open, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    green_door_info = observation.get('field_of_view', {}).get('green_door')\n\n    if green_door_info is not None:\n        return green_door_info.get('state') == 'open'\n    else:\n        return False\n"
