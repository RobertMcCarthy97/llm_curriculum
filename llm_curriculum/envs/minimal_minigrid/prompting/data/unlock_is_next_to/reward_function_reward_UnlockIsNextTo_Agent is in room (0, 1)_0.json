"\ndef is_in_room_0_1(observation) -> bool:\n    \"\"\"\n    This function checks if the agent is in the room labeled as (0, 1). \n\n    The room decipher information is extracted from the observation dictionary and is stored under \n    the \"agent_info\" key, using the subkey \"room\", that is supposed to hold a pair of integers (x, y), \n    representing the coordinates of the room the agent is currently in. \n\n    We directly compare this pair of integers with the target pair (0, 1) that indicates the room \n    the agent is expected to be in for the desired state.\n\n    :param observation: A dictionary encompassing the current observation.\n    :return: True if the agent is in the desired room, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    agent_room = observation['agent_info']['room']\n\n    return agent_room == (0, 1)\n"
