"\ndef is_blue_ball_next_to_grey_box(observation) -> bool:\n    \"\"\"\n    This function determines if the 'blue ball' object is located next to the 'grey box' object based \n    on the current observation state.\n    \n    The function assumes that 'next to' implies the blue ball is one cell away from the grey box, \n    either horizontally or vertically, but not diagonally. Thus, we're applying the Manhattan distance \n    calculation with a strict distance of 1. We are excluding diagonal proximity to adhere to typical \n    grid-based motion rules, assuming our agent is limited to up, down, left and right movements.\n    \n    Furthermore, the function assumes that the environment is grid-based, and the object positions are \n    defined as (x, y) pairs where x is incremented towards the right and y is incremented downwards. \n    For grid-based layouts, this is a conventional practice. Hence, the distances are calculated simply \n    by taking the absolute of subtracting coordinates from one another.\n    \n    The function checks that both the blue ball and the grey box exist within the agent's field of view \n    in the observation dictionary before proceeding to compute proximity. If either object isn't present \n    in the field of view, the function early-returns False.\n    \n    :param observation: A dictionary containing the agent's observation.\n    :return: True if the blue ball is next to the grey box, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Check if both 'blue_ball' and 'grey_box' exists in the observation's field of view\n    if 'blue_ball' in observation['field_of_view'] and 'grey_box' in observation['field_of_view']:\n        blue_ball_pos = observation['field_of_view']['blue_ball']['position']\n        grey_box_pos = observation['field_of_view']['grey_box']['position']\n\n        dx = abs(blue_ball_pos[0] - grey_box_pos[0])\n        dy = abs(blue_ball_pos[1] - grey_box_pos[1])\n        \n        # Return True if blue_ball is horizontally or vertically adjacent to grey_box\n        return (dx, dy) in [(1, 0), (0, 1)]\n    else:\n        # If either 'blue_ball' or 'grey_box' isn't within the field of view, we return False\n        return False\n"
