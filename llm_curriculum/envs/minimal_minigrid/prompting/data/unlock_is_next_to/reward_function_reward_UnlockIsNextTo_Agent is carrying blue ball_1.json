"\ndef is_carrying_blue_ball(observation) -> bool:\n    \"\"\"\n    This function checks if the agent is carrying the blue ball.\n    \n    We're assuming that the blue ball is an item that can be carried by the agent. \n    This assumption is based on the problem statement, which has the agent \n    manipulating the blue ball.\n    \n    The object currently being carried is represented as a string in the 'carrying' \n    field of the 'agent_info' key in the observation. We simply compare this string \n    to the string 'blue_ball' to check if the agent is currently carrying the blue ball. \n    \n    :param observation: A dictionary containing the observation.\n    :return: True if the agent is carrying the blue ball, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    object_in_possession = observation['agent_info']['carrying']\n    return object_in_possession == 'blue_ball'\n"
