"\ndef is_carrying_green_key(observation) -> bool:\n    \"\"\"\n    This function checks if the agent is carrying a green key.\n    \n    We're assuming that the 'carrying' field in 'agent_info' explicitly states the object\n    that the agent is currently carrying. In the case where the agent carries the green key, \n    the 'carrying' field should have the value 'green_key'. \n\n    It's also assumed that 'carrying' field is 'nothing' if agent is not carrying anything, \n    and that the 'key' is the only type of object that can have a color 'green'. \n\n    :param observation: A dictionary containing the observation.\n    :return: True if the agent is carrying a green key, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    carrying_info = observation['agent_info']['carrying']\n\n    return carrying_info == \"green_key\"\n"
