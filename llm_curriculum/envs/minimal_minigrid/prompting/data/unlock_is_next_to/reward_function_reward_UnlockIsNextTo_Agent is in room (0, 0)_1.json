"\ndef is_in_room_0_0(observation) -> bool:\n    \"\"\"\n    This function checks if the agent is in room (0, 0).\n    \n    We're assuming that the 'room' attribute in 'agent_info' provides the current \n    room location of the agent as a tuple. Since rooms are defined with discrete values\n    (corresponding to their row and column in grid layout), we can directly compare the\n    'room' attribute to the tuple (0, 0) to determine if the agent is located in room (0, 0).\n    \n    :param observation: A dictionary containing the observation.\n    :return: True if the agent is in room (0, 0), False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    agent_room = observation['agent_info']['room']\n\n    return agent_room == (0, 0)\n"
