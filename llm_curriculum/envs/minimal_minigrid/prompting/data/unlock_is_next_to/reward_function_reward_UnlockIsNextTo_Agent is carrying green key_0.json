"\ndef is_carrying_green_key(observation) -> bool:\n    \"\"\"\n    This function checks if the agent is carrying a green key.\n    \n    Given the agent_info embedded in each observation, we can directly inspect \n    the 'carrying' attribute for its current status. If the agent is carrying an object, \n    this attribute reflects the object being carried, if it's empty, then it will \n    return 'nothing'.\n    \n    Therefore, for checking the state 'Agent is carrying green key', we compare \n    the 'carrying' attribute with the string 'green_key'.\n    \n    :param observation: A dictionary containing the observation.\n    :return: True if the agent is carrying the green key, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    return observation['agent_info']['carrying'] == 'green_key'\n"
