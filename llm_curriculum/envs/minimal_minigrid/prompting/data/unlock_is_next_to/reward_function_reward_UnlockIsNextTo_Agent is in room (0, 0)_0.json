"\ndef is_in_room_0_0(observation) -> bool:\n    \"\"\"\n    This function checks whether the agent is in room (0, 0).\n\n    By accessing the 'room' attribute of the 'agent_info' from the observation, \n    we expect it to hold a tuple representing the x and y coordinates of the room \n    in which the agent is currently located. We assume these coordinates start at 0, so \n    room (0, 0) is the first room.\n\n    We're assuming that the 'room' information in 'agent_info' is accurate and \n    up-to-date at the time of the observation.\n\n    We return a boolean to indicate whether the agent\u2019s current room matches the \n    expected room, (0, 0).\n\n    :param observation: A dictionary containing the observation data.\n    :return: True if the agent is in room (0, 0), and False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    current_room = observation['agent_info']['room']\n    \n    return current_room == (0, 0)\n"
