"\ndef is_beside_red_ball(observation) -> bool:\n    \"\"\"\n    The function checks if the agent is adjacent to the red ball.\n\n    The interpretation and assumptions here are similar to the sample supplied. 'Beside' \n    is understood to indicate that the agent is one cell away from the ball, either \n    horizontally or vertically, but not diagonally. Hence, the Manhattan distance with \n    a distance of 1 is used here, and not the Euclidean distance.\n\n    The environment is presumed to be grid-like, and the positions are given as (x, y) pairs, \n    where x increases to the right, and y increases downward. Hence, the absolute difference \n    in x and y coordinates of the agent's and red ball's positions is calculated to determine distance.\n\n    If the red ball is not within the agent's field of view, the function will return False \n    as the agent cannot be next to the red ball if the ball is not visible to it.\n\n    :param observation: A dictionary containing the observation.\n    :return: True if the agent is beside the red ball, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    agent_pos = observation['agent_info']['position']\n    \n    if 'red_ball' in observation['field_of_view']:\n        red_ball_pos = observation['field_of_view']['red_ball']['position']\n\n        dx = abs(agent_pos[0] - red_ball_pos[0])\n        dy = abs(agent_pos[1] - red_ball_pos[1])\n\n        return (dx, dy) in [(1, 0), (0, 1)]\n    else:\n        return False\n"
