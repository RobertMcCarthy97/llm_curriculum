I have an agent in a MiniGrid environment.

The environment is:
${environment}

The agent can perform the following actions:
- Move forward
- Turn left 
- Turn right
- Pick up an object (max 1 at a time)
- Place object (if currently holding one)
- Open / close a door 

The final state the agent must reach is: '${mission}'.
Can you list the intermediate states that must be reached for the agent to complete the task?

Rules: 
1. Do this in the same style as 'red box is next to green ball'.  
2. Do not use dynamic/action information in the states (e.g. velocities actions), only use static information.
3. Always begin the list of intermediate states with <objectives> and end it with </objectives>

Follow this template: 
Thought:  ${description of reasoning process}
(repeat above any number of times needed...)

The objectives are: 
<objectives>
#. ${short description of intermediate state}
(repeat above any number of times needed...)
</objectives>

Example of intermediate state:
- 'Agent is next to grey door'
- 'Agent is carrying yellow key'
- 'Green door is open'
