I have an agent in a MiniGrid environment.

The environment is:
${environment}

The agent can perform the following actions:
- Move forward
- Turn left 
- Turn right
- Pick up an object (max 1 at a time)
- Place object (if currently holding one)
- Open / close a door 

The final state the agent must reach is: ${mission}.
Can you list the intermediate states that must be reached for the agent to complete the task?

Rules: 
1. Do this in the same style as "Red box is beside green ball".  
2. Do not use dynamic/action information in the states (e.g. velocities actions), only use static information.
